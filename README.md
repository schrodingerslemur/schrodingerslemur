# Brendan Hendrata  
**Full Stack • AI/ML • Embedded & Hardware ⚙️** <br>
**B.S. Electrical & Computer Engineering + CS, Carnegie Mellon University 🎓**

I build end-to-end systems across software, AI, and hardware. My experience spans full-stack development (React, Node.js, Flask), applied machine learning (PyTorch, PINNs, transformers), and emerging work in embedded systems and digital design.

I’ve worked across AI research internships, full-stack engineering fellowships, and chip-testing research while leading technical efforts at a non-profit. I’m now pushing deeper into embedded and hardware engineering, using my software and ML background to design efficient, production-ready systems.
